Representations of Diversity in Collections

## Outline plan

* API driven -- all functions handled by API
  * how will keys be granted?
* CRUD database structure
  * readable by all
  * searchable by all
  * writeable by partners
* user accounts
  * search for books and save them to your own "collection"
  * possibly support multiple collections per users
* analysis tools
  * per collection, report stats
* admin tools
  * review API key requests

## Proposed API endpoints
* ???
